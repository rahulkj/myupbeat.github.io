This is part 3 of playing around with kubernetes on Raspberry Pi's.

After installing the kubernetes clusters on Raspberry Pi's, I encountered an issue with running my [application](https://github.com/rahulkj/sample-k8s-app) on it.

I noticed a `/exec` error in the logs on my pod.

After inspecting this, I realized I was trying to run a OCI image that was generated with amd64 on an arm architecture hardware.

My initial docker file was using `openjdk:16-jdk-alpine` as the base image, which had support for only amd64.

I switch the base image to `openjdk:22-jdk-slim`, as it supported both amd64 and arm64

With this change, there was a need to generate images for my application for both amd64 and arm64

* To do this, I used `docker` cli to create and push the OCI images first.

```
docker buildx build --platform linux/amd64 -t rjain/sample-k8s-app:latest-amd64 --push .
docker buildx build --platform linux/arm64 -t rjain/sample-k8s-app:latest-arm64 --push .
```

* Next I created a manifest file to reference it on docker hub, that made both the images available under 1 tag
```
docker manifest create \
    rjain/sample-k8s-app:latest \
    --amend rjain/sample-k8s-app:latest-amd64 \
    --amend rjain/sample-k8s-app:latest-arm64

docker manifest push rjain/sample-k8s-app:latest
```

* Once the images were available in docker hub, I was able to [deploy](https://github.com/rahulkj/sample-k8s-app/blob/main/deployment.yaml) my app, and validate it using my ingress endpoint

```
>>> curl http://sample.k8s.int:30972/hello

{"greetingMessage":"Hi from k8s deployment!!"}
```

**NOTE:**
I created a A record for `*.k8s.int` that maps to one of the kubernetes node
