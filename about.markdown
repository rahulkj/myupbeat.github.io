Hello there!

Iâ€™m Rahul and I have significant experience in developing cloud native applications and infrastructure

My passion is to explore new technologies and apply them in my projects.

Iâ€™ve dirtied my hands in many technologies, namely

- Cloud Foundry
- VMWare virtualization
- IaaS (AWS/GCP/Azure/OpenStack/VMWare)
- Messaging Services like RabbitMQ, ActiveMQ
- NoSQL databases
- Spring framework
- Spring tool suite
- etcâ€¦

I blog on those articles which are hard to find on google, and those that I learnt the hard wayâ€¦ like the way you are doing now ðŸ˜‰

I love sharing the things I learn and hope you enjoy my posts!!
Also if you find my articles useful, do drop me a note.
